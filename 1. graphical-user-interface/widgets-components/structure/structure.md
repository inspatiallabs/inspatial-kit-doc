# Structure

When you build anything, a house, a painting, or an app, you need **a frame**.

- In a house, it’s the walls and floors.
- In a painting, it’s the canvas.
- In Spatial, it’s the **Structure** widget.

Without structure, you have chaos. Elements float around without clear boundaries or rules. The Structure Widget gives **shape** and **intent** to everything that comes after.

**Structure** is the skeleton of your app → gives layout meaning.
