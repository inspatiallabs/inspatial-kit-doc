# Widgets & Components

So far you have been composing components using renderer primitives. This section intoduces you to Widgets & Components. Unlike Renderer primimitives you compose components using <Tags>.

A Widget is a high-level primitive. It simple terms a widget contains multiple components. e.g an <InputField> has different variants of components i.e <TextField>, <NumberField> etc...

NOTE: Only high-level primitives (such as Input, Ornament, Presentation, etc.) support `variants`. Each variant/children can have multiple `formats`, which act as sub-variants.

## Rethinking Component Systems

Every UI framework makes you pick a side: speed or flexibility, copy-paste or monolith, web or native or 3D, smart adaptive or plain predictable. It‚Äôs always a compromise‚Äîease versus control, power versus simplicity. We saw the cracks, and now we‚Äôre breaking the wall completely.

### From Patchwork to True Composition

Traditionally, customizing a UI component system meant you were boxed in by whatever styling primitives the library predefined.

Then came the copy-and-paste composition pattern: give developers the raw component code scattered across a myriad of web only libraries and let them edit. It was a breakthrough but still **Patchwork**. Copying primitives isn‚Äôt efficient, wrapping components isn‚Äôt elegant even with the help of a command-line-interface (CLI) and teaching AI through scattered source files creates poor and the same design output across the board. Is it composition, yes! but a bolted **workaround** composition, **not built in** composition. Fundamentally with the copy-paste approach, you‚Äôre still patching over the limitations of a component library not solving the underlying problems.

So we went back to first principles and asked... What if users could install components the traditional way with ready-made styles but also unlock their entire anatomy for full styling and control?

We found our answer by looking at Flutter widgets. Instead of treating composition as a workaround, why not make the styling engine itself the foundation? That‚Äôs what we did with [InSpatial Style](./styling%20üü¢//introduction.md).

On InSpatial, **every component is already a widget tree**. You don‚Äôt copy code; you simply install and use it like any other library. But instead of being locked into a thin layer of styles, you unlock the **entire component anatomy**

- **Beautiful defaults**: Already there, with hundreds of pre-built themes and variables.
- **Unstyling**: Prefer to start from a clean slate? Opt into unstyled with a single flag.
- **Full transparency**: Native, not handed to you in a flat file.
- **Composition**: Not just a principle‚Äîit‚Äôs the ontology.
- **Distribution**: No schema hacks; the widget tree is the schema.
- **AI-ready**: Not just readable, but 60√ó more efficient because AI works against typed anatomy, not scattered source.

So you get the ease of installation you‚Äôre used to, without losing the power to go deep.

### From Plain to Intelligent

Most component systems are ‚Äúdumb‚Äù by default: they render what you tell them, but don‚Äôt adapt, don‚Äôt reason, and don‚Äôt help you avoid mistakes. InSpatial Widgets are **intelligent by design**. They expose their anatomy, variants, and settings in a way that‚Äôs both human- and AI-friendly. This means:

- **Self-documenting APIs**: Every widget describes its own structure, variants, and props.
- **Introspectable anatomy**: You can query, override, or extend any part of a widget‚Äîno black boxes.
- **AI-native**: The system is designed so LLMs can reason about, generate, and refactor components with high accuracy.
- **Strict contracts**: Widgets enforce prop types, variant options, and structure at runtime and in docs, so you can‚Äôt ‚Äúfall off the happy path‚Äù by accident.

This intelligence isn‚Äôt just for AI‚Äîit makes you faster, too. You get autocomplete, instant docs, and safe composition everywhere.

### From Web Only to Universal

Most UI libraries are web-first, with ‚Äúnative‚Äù or ‚Äú3D‚Äù as afterthoughts (if at all). InSpatial flips this: **universal by default**. Every widget and component is designed to render on web, mobile, desktop, and spatial platforms‚Äîno forks, no wrappers, no ‚ÄúReact Native‚Äù hacks.

- **Single source of truth**: One widget tree, all platforms.
- **Platform-optimized**: Styles, events, and layouts adapt automatically to the target environment.
- **No platform lock-in**: Move your app from web to mobile to XR with zero rewrite.
- **Consistent theming**: Colors, spacing, and tokens work everywhere, with platform-specific overrides only when you want them.

InSpatial Kit Widgets and Components are not just ‚Äúcross-platform‚Äù - they are **platform-native everywhere**. You build once, and your components feel right at home on any device, in any context.


## Control Flow

Control flows allow you to...

- **Structure & Control Flow Components:**
  _ `<Show when={signal}>`: Conditional rendering. Supports `true` and `else` props. For one-off static conditions, you can use inline typescript to return the desired branch directly just like in React(but will not have reactivity).
  _ `<List each={signalOfArray} track="key" indexed={true}>`: Efficiently renders lists with reconciliation by handling all list rendering scenarios. Automatically handles static arrays and signals, eliminates need for `derivedExtract`, provides direct item access in templates. Use `track` for stable keys when data changes completely. Exposes `getItem()`, `remove()`, `clear()` methods. View functions receive raw item data directly for clean, readable syntax.
  _ `<Async future={promise}>`: Manages asynchronous operations (pending, resolved, rejected states). `async` components automatically get `fallback` and `catch` props.
  _ **Error Handling in Asynchronous Components:** Implement robust error handling within `async` components. Utilize the `catch` prop of `<Async>` components or direct `fallback`/`catch` props on async components, and `try...catch` blocks for network requests to gracefully manage and display errors to the user.
  _ `<Dynamic is={componentOrTag}>`: Renders a component or HTML tag that can change dynamically.
  _ `<Fn ctx={value} catch={errorHandler}>`: Executes a function that returns a render function, useful for complex logic with error boundaries. \* **List Management:** Use `List` component's exposed methods (`getItem()`, `remove()`, `clear()`) for imperative list manipulation when needed.

- **`$ref`:** Special prop to get a reference to a DOM element or component instance (as a signal or function). **Critical for hot reload in dev mode:** always use `$ref` for component references, not `createComponent()` return values.
- **`expose()`:** Allows child components to expose properties/methods to their parent via `$ref`.
- **`capture()`:** Captures the current rendering context, useful for running functions (e.g., `expose()`) after `await` calls in async components.
- **Importing:** All built-in components can be imported directly from package `InSpatial`
- **`createComponent(template, props?, ...children)`:** Creates component instances
  **`renderer.render(container, component, props, ...children)`:** Renders a component into a container, with optional props and children.
  **`dispose(instance)`:** Cleans up component resources
  **`getCurrentSelf()`:** Gets current component instance
  **`snapshot()`:** Creates context snapshots for async operations
- **JSX Children in Control Flow Components:** When using components like `<Show>` and `<List>`, ensure their render function children return either a _single root element_ or a `Fragment` (`<>...</>`) if rendering multiple sibling elements. This prevents unexpected rendering issues.
- `**Fn`\*\* provides a render closure; inside it, you can read the table header groups and row model.
- **`R.c(tag, props, ...children)`** creates elements; `R.text(string)` creates text nodes.

## Structure

When you build anything, a house, a painting, or an app, you need **a frame**.

- In a house, it‚Äôs the walls and floors.
- In a painting, it‚Äôs the canvas.
- In Spatial, it‚Äôs the **Structure** widget.

Without structure, you have chaos. Elements float around without clear boundaries or rules. The Structure Widget gives **shape** and **intent** to everything that comes after.

**Structure** is the skeleton of your app ‚Üí gives layout meaning.

---

#### `<View>`

`View` is a variant of the Structure Widget. Its generally the entry-point to building a component. It‚Äôs the surface where everything else in your component gets painted or placed.

- That‚Äôs why you only need **one `<View>`** at the root of your component, just like you only need **one canvas** for a single painting.
- Having multiple `<View>`s at the same level is like starting several canvases for one artwork: confusing, fragmented, and difficult to manage.

**Why It Fills the Whole Screen**

By default, `<View>` expands to the **maximum width and height of the viewport**.

- This ensures your ‚Äúcanvas‚Äù is **complete**, no cutoff edges.
- But since it covers the whole space, it doesn‚Äôt scroll automatically. Why? Because if your canvas is already infinite, you don‚Äôt need scroll until your content overflows.

So scroll is **opt-in**, not forced. That‚Äôs where the `View`‚Äôs scrollbar settings come in.

**Scrolling In Views**

The `<View>` component is not just a passive box. It‚Äôs your **stage**.

- Sometimes the stage needs to allow the audience (users) to move around ‚Üí **scrollbars**.
- Sometimes the stage needs to shift moods, pace, or transitions ‚Üí **motion and animation**.

Because `View` is the stage, it controls these high-level experiences. You don‚Äôt sprinkle scroll or motion randomly across elements; you anchor them at the structural level.

**Example Usage**

```typescript
<View>
  <Stack variant="yStack" className="space-y-2 p-2 bg-(--brand) w-full">
    {Array.from({ length: 30 }).map((_, i) => (
      <YStack key={i} className="p-3 rounded bg-(--surface) text-(--primary)">
        Item {i + 1}
      </YStack>
    ))}
  </Stack>
</View>
```

**View `ScrollBar`Themes & Properties**

```typescript
// Thin (default)
<View scrollbar scrollbarTheme="thin">...</View>

// Minimal (thumb appears on hover)
<View scrollbar scrollbarTheme="minimal">...</View>

// Rounded
<View scrollbar scrollbarTheme="rounded">...</View>

// Pill
<View scrollbar scrollbarTheme="pill">...</View>

// Gradient
<View scrollbar scrollbarTheme="gradient">...</View>
```

#### `<Table>`

##### Zebra Table

A zebra table is just a table where every other row has a different background color‚Äîlike light, then slightly darker, then light again. This striping makes it easier for your eyes to follow a row across the page, especially in wide or crowded tables.

Tables are zebra-striped by default. Striping is applied in `TableStyle.body` using nested selectors (`& > tr:nth-child(odd|even)`) generated by the `@in/style` variant system, not Tailwind `odd:` utilities. Background colors use theme variables: `var(--background)` for odd rows and `var(--surface)` for even rows. No per-row logic is needed in views.

**Manual Overide of `Zebra` Table Row**

```jsx
import { Table } from "@inspatial/kit/data-flow";

<Table
  columns={fields}
  data={entries.get()}
  filterColumn="name" // Table handles search/filter internally
  headerBar={{
    display: true, // Show/hide header bar
    cta: {
      // Only actions are customizable
      display: true,
      importExport: {
        "on:presentation": {
          /* ... */
        },
      },
      newEntry: {
        label: "Add Entry",
        "on:presentation": {
          /* ... */
        },
      },
      actions: [
        /* custom buttons */
      ],
    },
  }}
  presentations={{ modals, drawers }}
/>;
```

## Presentation

#### Modal

```typescript
import { Modal } from "@inspatial/kit/presentation";
import { YStack } from "@inspatial/kit/structure";
import { Text } from "@inspatial/kit/typography";
import { Button } from "@inspatial/kit/ornament";

<Modal
  id="counter-modal"
  closeOnEsc
  closeOnScrim
  className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen w-screen m-auto"
>
  <YStack className="p-6 gap-3 w-[500px] h-[500px] bg-(--brand) rounded-3xl shadow-effect">
    <Text className="text-xl font-semibold">Title</Text>
    <Text>
      Use the buttons to adjust the counter and explore trigger props. This
      modal is controlled via on:presentation.
    </Text>
    <Button
      format="outline"
      on:presentation={{ id: "counter-modal", action: "close" }}
    >
      Close
    </Button>
  </YStack>
</Modal>;
```

#### Portals

Uses the Presentation Portals `Inlet/Outlet` to render components outside their original DOM hierarchy.

```typescript
import {
  PresentationInlet,
  PresentationOutlet,
  Modal,
} from "@inspatial/kit/presentation";

<Modal>
  {/* The Presentation Outlet displays content provided by the Inlet */}
  <PresentationOutlet fallback={() => <Text>Hello World</Text>} />
</Modal>;

{
  /* The Presentation Inlet sends its children to be rendered by the Outlet */
}
<PresentationInlet>
  <Text>Render on the modal</Text>
</PresentationInlet>;
```

## Ornament

### `<Tab>`

#### Anatomy

Historically Tabs have been used as owners of a view. But this is merely the case because the anatomy of a tab warrants that a Tab is simply a controller of a view.

## Navigation

### `<Sidebar>`

**Sidebar** vs **Drawer**
The difference between a Drawer and a Sidebar is in the "presentation". Like most Navigation widgets, a Sidebar is already in View whereas you need an action to trigger a presentation drawer.

## How to build a Scalable Widget or Component

- Start by understanding the widgets anatomy the parts i.e the different elements that its made up of e.g a Topbar might need Links and Buttons.
- Take each of those components probvided by InSpatial Kit and create a composable primitive from it separately
- define your styles in `style.ts`
- Finally use your `type.ts` to create define structure
