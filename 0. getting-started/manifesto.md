# The InSpatial Kit Manifesto

1. **We build, not wire.**
   80% wiring, 20% building is failure. Tools must serve creation, not consume it.

2. **Frameworks aren’t systems.**
   Renders without structure, state without meaning, design without intent... we reject toolchains without philosophy.

3. **Universal rendering, everywhere.**
   Write once, deploy to web, mobile, watches, XR, and beyond. No silos, no rewrites.

4. **JSX without baggage.**
   Keep the familiar syntax, drop the Virtual DOM, hydration, and compile-time religion.

5. **Runtime first, always.**
   No builds, no bundlers, no “million buzzwords.” Everything works live, at runtime, on any target.

6. **Composition over monoliths.**
   Modules must be independent, removable, and replaceable. Systems should harmonize, not entrap.

7. **There is no localhost.**
   Development should be as universal as deployment. `my.inspatial.app` replaces ports and tunnels.

8. **AI amplifies, never replaces.**
   Multi-agent, contract-bound intelligence verifies, not hallucinates. Code is designed for humans _and_ AIs.

9. **Games & XR are first-class.**
   Not afterthoughts. Creation, persistence, multiplayer, and deployment in one universal pipeline.

10. **Infrastructure, not fashion.**
    We don’t compete in the framework beauty contest. We’re building the universal development environment the stable foundation beneath them all.
