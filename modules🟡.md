## Modules
A Module is a package or bundled piece of code that can be installed on your InSatial Project to help extend your development workflow by adding and enhancing features. 

InSpatial Kit is built on fundamnetally modern priciples and technologies, while Node.js is an amazing tool, we firmly belive it is also the root cause of and hold back of many innovations across the Javascript/Typescript ecosystem 

### Using modules 
With InSpatial you do not install packages from NPM instead from the InSpatial Store. 
The InSpatial Store. The InSpatial Store is a modern JS/TS/WASM package registry built on `JSR`. Modules on the InSPatial Store are universal and headless by default and are built on the `InZero` (Deno) runtime. 

### Creating an InSpatial Module
InSpatial offers 3 core scopes to the general public and generally reserves the "@inspatial". These scopes include 

1. `@in`
2. `@xr` 
3. `@spatial` 

What this means is your modules can only exist on the InSpatial Store if they are prefixed with either of those scopes.
